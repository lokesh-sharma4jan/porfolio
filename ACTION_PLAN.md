#### Your Portfolio Talking Points:

**For "Tell me about yourself":**

```
I'm a Senior Backend Engineer with 7+ years of experience
building large-scale distributed systems. Currently at
Ernst & Young, I architect microservices processing over
1M daily financial transactions with 99.95% uptime.

I'm particularly passionate about system design - I've built
4 major platforms including a real-time financial data system
serving 30+ downstream applications with sub-240ms latency,
and a high-availability logistics infrastructure supporting
500+ locations nationwide.

I've delivered significant business impact - $500K+ in cloud
cost savings, 80% latency improvements, and 70% reduction in
production incidents. I'm now seeking L5/Senior+ roles where
I can leverage my expertise in distributed systems and
event-driven architecture to solve complex problems at scale.
```

**For "Greatest achievement":**

```
My most impactful project was architecting a real-time
financial data platform on AWS that processes 1M+ daily
transactions. The challenge was migrating from a monolithic
system while maintaining 99.9% availability.

I designed an event-driven microservices architecture using
AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and SQS/SNS, implementing CQRS pattern
for read/write separation. The result was 80% latency reduction
(from 1.2s to 240ms), $500K+ annual cost savings, and the
platform now serves 30+ downstream systems reliably.

What I'm most proud of is not just the technical solution,
but the business impact - we improved customer satisfaction
and enabled new product features that weren't possible before.
```
